          &nbsp;This post is supposed to discuss a problem in the tech industry. The videogame sector of the tech industry is the one that I'm most familiar with because, I'm a gamer. With the rise of mobile gaming and the general popularity of games nowadays, that doesn't mean much since many people can make that claim, but I mean that I'm invested into the community. I visit the news sites and the forums. I know the names and reputations of most of the high profile people in the industry. I scour the internet for news on upcoming games and until I started DBC a majority of my free time was spent gaming. Which is why I feel more than qualified to say this, something stinks in the land of Mario and Sonic. It has stunk for a while, but what was once bearable, has now become overwhelming. Affecting everyone passionate about gaming and dividing us, splitting us right down the middle, into those who would rather see change and those vehemently opposed to it.<br><br>
          &nbsp;It's not the fact that AAA games are constantly being delayed. It's not the F2P model, even though that is a construct of the devil. It's not pre-order incentives either. It's about the treatment of women in the culture and the treatment of all who vocalize their frustration with the rampant misogyny in the culture. But to understand the problem we must first look at the root.<br><br>
          &nbsp; Gaming culture, and geek culture as a whole, has always catered to men. Even now the sterotypes persist of the lonely nerd in his mother's basement, or the <q>dudebro</q> who drinks gallons of mountain dew and plays violent shooters. An image of a woman is not typically what one associates with someone who plays videogames. And in the past there was nothing wrong with it. Stereotypes come from a place of truth. The culture was filled with people like that, and while women did game (every girl I grew up with did), the overwhelming majority of gamers back then were men. So the companies catered to us. Games were developed by us, for us and marketed towards us. But as the culture has become more mainstream, the demographics have changed. Approximately 48% of all people who play video games are women and while they are still the minority they are no longer <q>minor</q> and with the rise of social networks their voices are no longer minor either.<br><br> 
          &nbsp;It all started with a series of videos, made by Anita Sarkeesian, critiquing the portrayal of female characters in video games. While her examples were at times disingenuous, her intentions were noble. The responses to her videos were overwhelmingly vitriolic. She was attacking our precious games and thus she was attacking us. It was a declaration of war and we needed to respond appropriately. So we did. We left thousands of offensive comments on her videos and when she stopped allowing comments we sent them to her on twitter. After all, she had come to ruin gaming, something that was precious to us. Yet she persisted and now others were joining her. Not just women, but men too. This was no longer a crusade against a sole woman. This was now a war for the soul of gaming and we had to win, by any means necessary. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=doxxing&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8">Doxxing</a> and threats of death and rape would be our weapons. Accusations of censorship, our shield.
          Ignorance, our magnificent steed. Gamergate, the name of our cause. "It's about ethics in gaming journalism." Said seriously by those who support gamergate. Said ironically by everyone else. It began with <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=zoe+quinn&spell=1">Zoe Quinn</a> as the <q>quinnspiracy</q> and culminated in a Law &amp; Order: SVU episode.<br><br>
          &nbsp;There had long been suspicions of collusion between devs and the media for favorable reviews. When Quinn's ex-boyfriend claimed she had cheated on him with five other men, who were supposedly part of the industry, there was finally proof. And she had done it using her lady parts! A particularly heinous offense. Nevermind that the only one named had never even written a review on her game. That was merely a technicality. Nothing would stop this train. Not even her ex-boyfriend admitting that he had made a mistake. So we doxxed her and forced her out of her home. A small victory, but the war still had to be won. One homeless woman wasn't enough. More needed to be placed in the same situation. Even geek culture icon, Felicia Day, wasn't safe. She merely expressed her fear of commenting on the situation and was doxxed. However, the most audacious of all actions, was a bomb threat, called into Utah State University, to prevent Anita Sarkeesian from talking there.<br><br>
          &nbsp;Of course there has been resistance. Devs signed open letters denouncing sexism and misogyny in the culture. Journalists wrote articles proclaiming and celebrating the death of the gamer identity. Websites banned anyone who claimed to be a part of, or even empathized with, gamergate and deleted comments. Even the FBI is involved. However gamergate has not truly been deterred. After all, how do you kill a beast with thousands of heads and no heart? Thus the war is not over, yet the flames have died down. It is no longer as hot a topic as it once was, yet the two sides still fight. One in the name of ignorance and the other in the name of progression. As horrible as this culture war has been for some, I truly believe that good has come out of it and will continue to. For years the issue was largely ignored until Anita rattled the hornet's nest. Now it's the most hotly debated topic, resulting in efforts from both fans and professionals, to make the culture a better place, for all.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp;I didn't just pick this topic because it's the one I'm most comfortable with. I also picked it because it is indicative of a problem in the tech industry as a whole. A problem that needs to be rectified. We need more women in STEM positions. However, for this to happen, the environment needs to first be more inclusive, because even the women that enter eventually leave. Not just women either. Any marginalized demographic can, and should, benefit from such an environment. I come from New York City. Born and raised. Arguably the most diverse city in America. Growing up my classes were filled with kids from multiple ethnic backgrounds. I want workplaces and conferences to be as diverse as my classrooms were. However, I hope what happened in the videogame industry isn't what needs to happen for this to happen in the tech industry as a whole.
