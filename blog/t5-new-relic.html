          &nbsp; So I had been given an assignment to build my own sorting method for Ruby Arrays. While researching sorting algorithms for Ruby I came across a website that had a more fleshed out code of the basic idea I had for my sorting method. So I'm looking at the code, breaking down what it does in my head so I can add it to what I already have, when an ad descends from the heavens of the webpage. Since I have Adblock this confused the hell out of me but then I saw what the ad said: "New Relic. When your software looks good, you do too. Deploy New Relic and see for yourself." With a button to the far right saying: "Free T-Shirt, Please!"<br><br>&nbsp;Now I <b>LOVE</b> free things, so even though I had no idea what New Relic was and had no real interest in it I clicked and was sent <a href="http://newrelic.com/sp/datanerd?utm_source=SITE&utm_medium=text_ad&utm_content=LookGood&utm_campaign=DataNerd&mpc=TA-SITE-generic-EN-Signup-DataNerd-LookGood">here</a>. It was at this point that the shirt began to matter to me less than the program. So I've gone on this long-winded story on HOW I found New Relic, but yet haven't told you WHAT it is or what it does. and I won't. Instead, I'll let them explain it real quickly.<br><br>

          &nbsp;So to me, as a budding Web Dev, this sounds awesome. I hate it when I have to troubleshoot THIS site and it's almost as basic as possible. I hate troubleshooting the simple programs I've written so far where the amount of lines usually doesn't even crack 200. Imagine troubleshooting when a site becomes more complicated. Sometimes it's not even about troubleshooting, sometimes it's just about making your web apps faster and more efficient. Benchmarking is an important aspect of coding and just like Roml said, use tools to help you help yourself. When a person's code is evaluated, it's not just the program undergoing an evaluation, the person themself, their ability, is as well. Not only can something like this help you build, it can help you learn how to build better if you let it.<br><br>&nbsp;But of course now you're thinking "Yeah that's nice and all but how much does it cost?" <a href="http://newrelic.com/application-monitoring/pricing">Boom</a>. There you'll find the pricing models and what they include. The Lite version is free forever and gives you a 14 day trial of the Pro version ($149/month) so you get to test them both out. The Enterprise version requires directly calling them for a quote. One of those "If you're wondering about the price you probably can't afford it." type things. And unless you're building the next Facebook you probably won't need to. Here's a link to all their services: <a href="http://newrelic.com/products">Boom again</a>. And here's a link to a page filled with videos of testimonials and people using their services: <a href="http://newrelic.com/resources/videos">Boom cubed</a>. Check them out, their services are free so it can't hurt and did I mention that they're giving away free shirts?
