          &nbsp;As you may or may not have noticed, I'm not using wordpress or any other site that makes it easy to build a blog. This decision was not mine at first. When I entered DBC we were required to build our own blogs from scratch. We had to do the HTML, CSS and whatever else we wanted added ourselves. I'm not a fan of blogging, I didn't want to build one at all and especially not without any help from sites like Tumblr or Blogspot. But it was either that or decline and go back to being a bum. The correct option was clear. So I spent hours making this basic blog. Every single line of code (that's not saying much, templates >) was written by me. When something goes wrong I have to go in and edit the code. When links are dead I have to edit every webpage the links were on. When I write a new post I have to update all the other pages with links to the new post. It's a pain and absolutely no fun. When I started at Flatiron I was told I was going to have to write blog posts here too, but there'd be no restrictions on where and how I make my blog. I could make a better one! One that's easier to manage and prettier to look at. Yet I kept this one. Why?<br><br>&nbsp;It's good practice and as a budding developer I need as much as possible. When I begin doing this professionally it's going to be like this. Sites aren't abandoned after they're made. They're watched and edited afterwards. Sometimes things are added, sometimes they're taken out and sometimes they're just changed. And every time, it requires opening up the hood and looking directly at the inside. Getting elbow deep into the code and making something beautiful. However, that's not the only reason. I'm also using it as a barometer of my progress. My site is just that, a static site, basic, clearly something made by a beginner. I have no Javascript, or Jquery now, because while I know them, I'm not comfortable enough to implement them. I would be embarrassed to show anyone my CSS file. I don't even want to look in there and see it. There can't be any more than 20 lines of code. I have no comment section, there are no drop down menus at all, besides clicking on links there's zero interactivity. But it won't stay like this. When I first built we were told to update the site regularly with what we had learned. Even though (as far as I know) it's not a requirement here, I still plan to do so. And in the future, when my blog is beautiful and something I'm truly proud of, with every line of code typed out by me, I'll look back at my pobre blog and I'll see how far both it and I have come and I'll smile.
