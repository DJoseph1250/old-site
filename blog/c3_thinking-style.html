          &nbsp; I've always known about introverts, extroverts and the 16 personality types. I've taken multiple tests that told me I was an INTP, although I prefer to think of myslf an an ANTP(the word ambivert describes me better than introvert). However I had not heard of the Gregorc personality types until I started DBC.<br><br>
          &nbsp; When my results told me I was both, overwhelmingly, an Abstract Sequential and an Abstract Random thinker, I was slightly confused. Sequential and random are opposites. How could my highest scores be in both? But so is concrete and abstract. These types aren't meant to be one or the other. People are complicated and can't be summed up simply. It's why you get a score in each type, instead of just one result like with the Myers-Briggs types. These types aren't meant to be boxes to place oneself into. They make up one big box that parts of you fit into. No one is <b>only</b> Abstract Random or Concrete Sequential. We are all sums of all the types. We are just more of one type than the other.<br><br>
          I am overwhelmingly Abstract with a slight preference towards Sequential instead of Random. When I did more research, I saw just how much of both I fell into. But on descriptions where they conflict, I do tend to agree more with the AS one than the AR one. For example, Abstract Randoms prefer group work to working alone. I prefer to work alone, which descriptions of Abstract Sequentials supports. That doesn't mean that I fall completely into AS. There are some characterizations that don't describe me at all. I despise lecture and would rather do something my own way rather than follow tradition.
          <br><br>
          &nbsp; The purpose of taking these tests was to learn our thinking styles so that we could better learn.....how to learn. However, they taught me nothing about myself that I didn't already know, since I've always been a very introspective person. Essentially I've known my thinking style for years. Research told me that Abstract Randoms have trouble working within time limits. I already knew this and more. I also knew I disliked working with others. Simply, I've just been dealing with it. Sometimes, to get things done you have to go outside of your comfort zone. What one wants to do and what one has to do, isn't always going to be the same.<br><br>
          &nbsp; What was more useful to me was indentifying my mindset and realizing how much it has held me back and that I could change. I had a fixed mindset. I believed that my abilities were already determined. That there were things I was good at and that I would always be good at them. I also believed that there were things I simply wasn't good at and never would be. I was afraid of struggling with anything becauase it would mean that I wasn't as smart as I thuoght I was. I shied away from challenges. I put in minimal effort on purpose so that if I failed I could always say that I never tried. I was even scared to apply to DBC because I was afraid of failure and what it would mean. That kind of thinking didn't work out too well for me in the past. But true to my mindset I didn't really believe I could change. But I need to change. I need to adapt a fixed mindset. I've stopped telling myself and others that I can't or never will be able to do something. It's a small step but change isn't always instanteous. Gradual change is just as good.
