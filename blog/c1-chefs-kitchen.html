          &nbsp;When I decided to apply for DBC, I had this idea in my head, that I would go, do what I needed to do and gain a job and a valuable skill.<br>I was concerned with the destination, rather than the journey. I had the restaurant mentality.<br> "I'll take an order of Ruby on Rails, to go. Thank you. It comes with a side order of a job right? Ok just checking."<br><br>&nbsp;My mother used to tell me "You don't go to school to socialize, you go to school to learn."<br> Advice I took to heart when I was younger, but it made me miserable in school.<br> So I took it to the other end of the spectrum in HS.<br>A lot of socializing with not too much learning. While it was fun, I barely got out.<br> I went from one extreme to another and I wasn't too keen on reliving my HS experience in college, so I went back to how I used to be.<br> I went to school to learn and not socialize, but again I was miserable.<br> I never learned balance and in order to get as much as I can out of DBC, I must learn.<br><br> &nbsp;If I didn't watch the fireside chat I might've never realized the mistake I was about to make, again.<br>Shereef said most people entering the program would have two kinds of fears.<br> Fear of knowing too little, and fear of knowing too much. I'm not one of those people.<br> I'm not worried about knowing too little, or too much. Fear of knowing too little is ridiculous when I'm attending to learn.<br> I'm also aware of how little I know, so I'm not worried about knowing too much.<br> Besides, I'm used to working with people who know less.<br> Comes with being an older sibling and a former tutor.<br><br>
