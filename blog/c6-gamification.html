          &nbsp;I play a lot of video games. Or I used to. I don't have too much time for them anymore.
          But I still get my daily fix through the magic of Gamification. Gamifiwhat? Gamification. No, I didn't just make
          that word up. It does exist, has existed for years and is something we've all been subjected to. But what is it?<br><img src="http://declineofscarcity.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/gamification_torn_def2.png"><br>Examples of implementation of this practice are sites like, <a href="https://www.learn.co">Learn</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> and <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>. Sites most of us have heard of and probably used. However, there are many more, most of which are sites created for the purpose of education. Why education? Learning isn't always fun. Sometimes people need incentives, extra motivation, but these motivations don't always have to be tangible things, with real world applications.<br><img src="http://www.genie-connect.com/system/redactor_assets/pictures/122/gamification_image_for_blog.gif"><br>Who remembers getting a gold star in Kindergarten? It was worthless but you felt like a champion when you got one. And you were pretty upset when one was taken away. "But that's the workings of a child's mind! I'm an adult now!" Ok, Mr/Ms Adult, how many of us finished a lab only to feel cheated when the green check didn't show up on Learn? Or continued a lab we were thoroughly frstrated by, not out of a pure desire to learn but moreso to see that sweet sweet green at the end? Look out! Giant infographic ahead!<br>
