          &nbsp; When I was in the 7th grade, my middle school physics teacher had us do a project. We were to create a container for an egg, that would survive a drop of considerable height. Now you're probably wondering what this has to do with margins, borders and padding. You're probably asking yourself, <q>How does this help me learn the difference between these 3 properties?</q>. That's a good question.<br><br>&nbsp; I didn't fully understand the differences between them, until I remembered that silly project. I failed it by the way. The <b>padding</b> between the egg and the <b>borders</b> of the box was stuffed in too tightly. The shock from the fall traveled right through and cracked the egg.<br><br>&nbsp; Web page content is a lot like that egg in that box. Every link and image is surrounded by a border. Sometimes it's visible, sometimes it's not. It depends on the wishes of the developer or their client. The thickness of borders can vary too. One girl had am egg container that was all border. It was custom made. There was no need for padding. The borders were so thick it didn't matter.<br><br>&nbsp; Padding is the space between the content of the box and the border. If you put a little padding on the left, the content will move right. If you put it on the right, it will move left. Margin is the space between borders. If you have two boxes, margin is the space between those two boxes. If you're still confused here's a picture of the CSS box model to go along with my babbling. Hopefully it helps:<br> <img src="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/images/boxdim.png" alt="">
