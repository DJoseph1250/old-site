          &nbsp; Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, the bane of everyone who uses computers extensively. I've gotten it at least once every year since my first laptop, in varying states of intensity. There is no one cause CTS can be attributed to, which is what makes it difficult to prevent. But Carpal Tunnel isn't some inevitability like, death. It can be prevented. Yes people, I am telling you there is a cure to Hacker Herpes. But wait, what is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome? Most people have heard of it, many have experienced it, but what exactly is it? CTS is brought on by too much pressure on the central nerve in one's wrist, the median nerve. So it's basically a pinched nerve. Wait, didn't I say there are many causes? Then how can it truly be prevented? Well first, that's a stupid question, don't worry I'm not judging, and second I'm just about to get into that.
          <br><br>
          <h3>&nbsp;1. POSTURE</h3>

          <br><br>
          &nbsp;It's amazing what good posture can do for a human being. This magical way of sitting and standing even helps prevent CTS. What's good posture? See above and lets move on to two.
          <br><br>
          <h3>&nbsp;2. REST</h3>

          &nbsp;Now I don't mean that you should fall asleep at your desk like the guy above. You'll probably end up getting too much rest when you get fired. I mean just take a break. Step away from the keyboard and take 5. Maybe listen to Take Five, it's a good song. Just don't sit there for hours mashing away at keys. Breaks are good for the mind and the body and they'll both thank you later.
          <br><br>
          <h3>&nbsp;3. EXERCISE</h3>

          &nbsp;This might be a shock, but exercise is actually good for the body. Who knew? However by exercise I don't mean work on your glutes. There are specific exercises you can do to help:<br><br>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Place your hands together at your upper chest as if you were praying, then bring them down to your stomach, while still keeping them together. Hold for a couple of seconds, then rinse and repeat.<br><br>

            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
              Extend your arm all the way with your palm facing upwards and then stretch it back. Hold for a couple of seconds, then rinse and repeat.<br><br>
              <img src="http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/media/medical/hw/h9991357_005.jpg">
            </li>
            <br><br>
            <li>
              Do the same as number 2, except this time have your wrist facing the opposite way. As always rinse and repeat.
