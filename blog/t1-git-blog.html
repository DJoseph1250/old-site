			&nbsp;My very first blog and my very first blog post. The purpose of this post is to teach you, Git/GitHub newbie, about Git and GitHub and how they work in conjunction.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;First let us start with one simple fact: <b>Git and Github ARE NOT the same</b>. Some of you may have gleaned that already, but for those who didn't, now you know. Git operates only on your computer. GitHub exists online. Now that we've gotten that out of the way, we shall begin with Git.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;<q>Git is a distributed revision control system with an emphasis on speed, data integrity,and support for distributed, non-linear workflows</q>. Simple right? No? Okay then, simply put, Git is an open-source version control program. Still a bit confused? Don't worry, I'm about to explain it a bit more in-depth. Version control is a way of keeping track of the changes you make to a file. It also gives you the option to revert back to those states if necessary and freely create new versions without taking up too much space. Git tracks these changes through "commits". Commits are essentially save points. When you're ready, you tell Git that you want to make a commit and save your changes. <q>But what happens when a certain file has too many commits to keep track of mentally? When a file has hundreds of commits a timestamp won't help me</q>. That's an excellent question and observation good citizen. The answer: Git won't allow you to finish a commit without a commit message. A short message that summarizes the changes and current state of the file. You could say that Git is committed (See what I did there?) to you making commit messages. They're simply that important for you or anyone viewing your works.<br><br>
			&nbsp;However, things happen to computers. It doesn't matter how many commits you have if your computer is lost/stolen or the hard drive becomes corrupted. Here comes GitHub to the rescue! I like to think of it as a more refined Dropbox. When I first heard of it my opinion was slightly different. Instead of refined I considered it to be needlessly complicated. I formed this opinion largely from a place of ignorance and foolishly dismissed it. I'm now going to try to explain GitHub and it's advantages to you, as simply as I can, so that you don't make the same mistake I did.<br><br>
			&nbsp;Git creates repositories (Git enabled folders) locally. They're only on your computer. GitHub gives you the ability to create repositories online. I actually prefer to first create a repository on GitHub and then clone (download) it to my computer. GitHub also makes it easy to share files with other. As long as one has access to a repository, they can fork (copy) that repository to their own personal GitHub account, or just clone it to their hard drive. This can be useful when working on projects with others or when you just want to share.
			<br><br>
			&nbsp;Learning Git and Github may seem daunting at first, but when you spend just a little time with them, you'll realize just how simple they can be.
